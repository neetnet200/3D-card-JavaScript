# 3D-card-JavaScript

My portfolio needs a focus! I'm going to create a card which will fit on a mobile screen, and has simple 3D functionality 

ðŸ›µ Able to open VS code in live server, used port 5500

ðŸ›µ Wrote the code in HTML | CSS | Javascript

ðŸ›µ Added font family: Orbitron (from google fonts) color: Bronze or #cd7f32, which works with the aqua I've chosen for the portfolio color

ðŸ›µ Pushed to github

ðŸ›µ Now to move this code into my portfolio website... which is to convert it to React.js
